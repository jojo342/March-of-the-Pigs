# March-of-the-Pigs
Final project from ART 286 course: Design for the Internet.  Assignment Brief: For this project you will design and develop an Interactive Type Specimen for a Google font of your choice. For this project you will work with traditional design attributes such as composition, color, scale, value, etc. in combination with interactive attributes such as sequence, narrative, behavior, participation, change, aspects of time and motion. The ability to “hide” and “reveal” elements or information, link to sections of your specimen, and / or to external links will also be important considerations
